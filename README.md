# Welcome to the Bearth-World wiki! By CreativeBrains  

This project aims to be the circle between BearthWorld and their clients

## Getting Started

Our APP should be available for both Android and IOS to run natively on those environments and meet the users' expectations 

### Prerequisites

An Android or An iPhone 


### Installing

for now, go to http://35.168.41.192/

## UseCase

BearthWorldwas created in response to the poor treatment and quality of servicewomen of color have received in the hospital during childbirth. Our mission is to educate, give people the best quality, and to always do what the mother wants. We provide doula and midwifery services from prenatal to postpartum and will also hold various childbirth education courses. We are currently based here in Kansas City but we are hoping to expand in the future. Also with our service, every 3rd birth will go to the low-income family of our choosing.


The mobile application should be available to both our clients and our midwives and doulas. They would be able to create an account and link with social media. Our clients should be able to find and connect with a doula, schedule appointments, and sign up for courses. The scheduler would allow midwives and doulas to post their schedules and allow clients to schedule any open slots. This application would also have a contraction timer that will alert the midwife when the clientâ€™s contractions become closer together. The navigation should be smooth and easily engageable as we may have older midwives and doulas on staff as well as older clients.
